# This follows the format of the *nix /etc/hosts file
# and each line is a single, complete entry.
# The first field is an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
# The next field is a domain or sub domain name.
# The next 0 to N fields are aliases for the domain name
# that will result in a CNAME record.
# A comment may end the line. Certain key words in a
# comment are recognized by the parser:
#    [mx]         - the host is a mail server for all domains
#    [nomx]       - this domain does not have a mail server
#    [ns1]        - this is the primary name server
#    [ns2]        - this is the secondary name server
#    [priority=N] - priority for a mail server

# Note that IPv4 addresses starting with the following
# octets are ignored:
#    127
#    10
#    192.168
